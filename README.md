# **EasyShop API**

## **Project Overview**

The **EasyShop API** is a RESTful service designed to power an online store. It allows users to:
- Browse products in the store.
- Add or remove items from their shopping cart.
- Complete purchases.

It also includes features for administrators, such as:
- Organizing products into categories.
- Adding, updating, or deleting products in the store.

Think of it as the "behind-the-scenes worker" that keeps the store running smoothly.

## **Key Features**
- User Registration and Login.
- Category Management for admins.
- Planned shopping cart and profile management.
- RESTful API endpoints for seamless interaction.
